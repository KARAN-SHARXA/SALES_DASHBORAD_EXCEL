A complete and polished documentation for your Excel-based **Sales Dashboard Project**, including data cleaning, modeling, pivot tables, visuals, and dashboard creation. This README is written in a clear, professional, and upload‑ready format.

## 📌 **Project Summary**

This project showcases a fully developed **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Excel**. The dashboard helps a shop/business understand its sales performance using clean data, pivot tables, and visually interactive charts.

The goal of the project was to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights using Excel's analytics and visualization tools.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives of the Project**

* Clean and prepare raw sales data for analysis.
* Create structured tables for better data organization.
* Use Pivot Tables to generate insights and KPIs.
* Build an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
* Provide screenshots and a video walkthrough of the dashboard.

## 🧹 **1. Data Cleaning (Preprocessing)**

Performed using Excel tools like **Remove Duplicates**, **Find & Replace**, **Data Type Formatting**, **Text-to-Columns**, and **Filters**.

### ✔ Key Cleaning Tasks Completed:

* Removed duplicate rows.
* Corrected inconsistent spelling in Category, Product, and City.
* Filled missing values logically.
* Standardized Date format (DD-MM-YYYY).
* Converted Amount & Quantity fields to proper numeric types.
* Cleaned currency formatting (e.g., INR/USD).

---

## 🧱 **2. Data Modeling (Structuring the Dataset)**

The dataset was reorganized for efficient analysis.

### ✔ Data Modeling Steps:

* Converted sheets into **Excel Tables** for better referencing.
* Created lookup tables (Category, Location, Product info).
* Defined relationships between tables (if using Power Pivot).
* Ensured proper formatting of Date, Numbers, and Text fields.

This step made the dataset analysis‑ready.

## 📊 **3. Pivot Table Creation**

Along with creating Pivot Tables, several analytical questions were answered to understand sales behavior and customer trends.

### ✔ Analytical Questions Answered:

* **Which month recorded the highest total sales?**
* **Which month had the highest number of orders?**
* **Who purchased more — Men or Women?**
* **Which age group contributed the most to total sales?** (if applicable)
* **Top 10 States contributing the highest revenue**
* **Which product categories performed the best?**
* **Which cities placed the most orders?**
* **Quantity vs Revenue trend over time**
* **Which payment methods were used the most?** (optional)

These questions helped uncover deep insights from the dataset.

## 📊 **3. Pivot Table Creation (Base Analysis)****

Multiple Pivot Tables were created to study different aspects of sales performance.

### ✔ Pivot Tables Created:

* Total Sales by Month
* Sales by Product Category
* Sales by State/City
* Top 10 Products (SKU‑wise)
* Quantity vs Revenue Trends
* Customer or City-level breakdown

These pivot tables were later used to build the final dashboard.

## 📈 **4. Dashboard Creation (Final Output)**

The dashboard is designed to be interactive, minimal, and easy to understand.

### ✔ Dashboard Features:

* **Slicers** for Month, Category, City, Currency
* Monthly Sales Line Chart
* Category‑wise Sales Column Chart
* KPI Cards showing:

  * Total Revenue
  * Total Quantity Sold
  * Average Order Value (AOV)
